# Card

**Import:** `import { Card, type CardProps } from "@opal/components";`

A container component with configurable background, border, padding, and rounding. Has two mutually-exclusive modes:

- **Plain** (default) — renders children inside a single styled `<div>`.
- **Expandable** (`expandable: true`) — renders children as an always-visible header plus an `expandedContent` prop that animates open/closed.

## Plain mode

Default behavior — a plain container.

```tsx
import { Card } from "@opal/components";

<Card padding={4} border="solid">
  <p>Hello</p>
</Card>;
```

### Plain mode props

| Prop          | Type                            | Default     | Description                                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `padding`     | `Spacing`                       | `4`         | Padding, as a spacing step (`N / 4` rem)                               |
| `rounding`    | `Rounding`                      | `3`         | Corner radius step (`N / 4` rem, or `"full"`)                          |
| `background`  | `"none" \| "light" \| "heavy"`  | `"light"`   | Background fill intensity                                              |
| `border`      | `"none" \| "dashed" \| "solid"` | `"none"`    | Border style                                                           |
| `borderColor` | `StatusVariants`                | `"default"` | Status-palette border color (needs `border` ≠ `"none"`)                |
| `disabled`    | `boolean`                       | `false`     | Dims the card and shows a not-allowed cursor. Visual only — see below. |
| `ref`         | `React.Ref<HTMLDivElement>`     | —           | Ref forwarded to the root div                                          |
| `children`    | `React.ReactNode`               | —           | Card content                                                           |
| `data-*`      | `string \| boolean`             | —           | Forwarded to the root. See below.                                      |

### `disabled`

`disabled` dims the card and gives it a not-allowed cursor. It is **visual only** —
children stay interactive, because a card is a container and suppressing what it
holds is a stronger claim than dimming it:

```tsx
<Card disabled>…</Card>
```

Compose `Disabled` from `@opal/core` when clicks should be blocked as well, or
when you want a tooltip explaining why:

```tsx
<Disabled disabled tooltip="Connect the app first">
  <Card disabled>…</Card>
</Disabled>
```

It is a boolean rather than a variant value, so it stacks with `background` and
`border` instead of replacing them — a disabled card can still be transparent
with a dashed border.

In expandable mode the whole card dims, header and expanded body together.

### `data-*` attributes

Any `data-*` prop is forwarded to the card's root element, so an application can
label a card for tests or analytics:

```tsx
<Card data-card>…</Card>
```

A card owns how it looks, not what the surrounding app calls it — `data-*` is the
app's namespace, and silently dropping it is worse than either forwarding or
rejecting it. Only `data-*` is picked up. `className` and `style` stay out, so the
card's appearance is still its own; behavioural props such as `onClick` are a
deliberate API decision rather than something inherited by a rest spread (use
`SelectCard` for an interactive card).

The card's own `data-background`, `data-border`, `data-shadow`, and
`data-opal-status-border` are written after the forwarded attributes, so a caller
cannot repurpose them to drive the stylesheet.

### Padding scale

`padding` is a spacing step, not a preset: `N` is `N / 4` rem, the same scale Tailwind
uses. So `padding={2}` is the same distance as `p-2`, and the default `4` is `1rem`.

### Rounding scale

`Rounding` is on the same scale as `Spacing`: `N` is `N / 4` rem, so
`rounding={2}` is the same distance as `padding={2}`.

| `rounding` | rem     | px   |
| ---------- | ------- | ---- |
| `0.5`      | `0.125` | 2    |
| `1`        | `0.25`  | 4    |
| `2`        | `0.5`   | 8    |
| `3`        | `0.75`  | 12   |
| `4`        | `1`     | 16   |
| `5`        | `1.25`  | 20   |
| `"full"`   | —       | pill |

## Expandable mode

Enabled by passing `expandable: true`. The type is a discriminated union — `expanded` and `expandedContent` are only available (and type-checked) when `expandable: true`.

```tsx
import { Card } from "@opal/components";
import { useState } from "react";

function ProviderCard() {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Card
      expandable
      expanded={open}
      expandedContent={<ModelList />}
      border="solid"
      rounding={4}
    >
      {/* always visible — the header region */}
      <div
        onClick={() => setOpen((v) => !v)}
        className="flex items-center justify-between cursor-pointer"
      >
        <ProviderInfo />
        <SvgChevronDown
          className={cn("transition-transform", open && "rotate-180")}
        />
      </div>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### Expandable mode props

Everything from plain mode, **plus**:

| Prop              | Type              | Default | Description                                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `expandable`      | `true`            | —       | Required to enable the expandable variant           |
| `expanded`        | `boolean`         | `false` | Controlled expanded state. Card never mutates this. |
| `expandedContent` | `React.ReactNode` | —       | The body that animates open/closed below the header |

### Behavior

- **No trigger baked in.** Card does not attach any click handlers. Callers wire their own `onClick` / keyboard / button / etc. to toggle state. This keeps `padding` semantics consistent across modes and avoids surprises with interactive children.
- **Always controlled.** `expanded` is a pure one-way visual prop. There is no `defaultExpanded` or `onExpandChange` — the caller owns state entirely (`useState` at the call site).
- **No React context.** The component renders a flat tree; there are no compound sub-components (`Card.Header` / `Card.Content`) and no exported context hooks.
- **Rounding adapts automatically.** When `expanded && expandedContent !== undefined`, the header's bottom corners flatten and the content's top corners flatten so they meet seamlessly. When collapsed (or when `expandedContent` is undefined), the header is fully rounded.
- **Content background is always transparent.** The `background` prop applies to the header only; the content slot never fills its own background so the page shows through and keeps the two regions visually distinct.
- **Content has no intrinsic padding.** The `padding` prop applies to the header only. Callers own any padding inside whatever they pass to `expandedContent` — wrap it in a `<div className="p-4">` (or whatever) if you want spacing.
- **Animation.** Content uses a pure CSS grid `0fr ↔ 1fr` animation with an opacity fade (~200ms ease-out). No `@radix-ui/react-collapsible` dependency.

### Accessibility

Because Card doesn't own the trigger, it also doesn't generate IDs or ARIA attributes. Consumers are responsible for wiring `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `aria-labelledby`, etc. on their trigger element.

## Complete prop reference

```ts
type CardBaseProps = {
  padding?: Spacing;
  rounding?: Rounding;
  background?: "none" | "light" | "heavy";
  border?: "none" | "dashed" | "solid";
  borderColor?: StatusVariants;
  ref?: React.Ref<HTMLDivElement>;
  children?: React.ReactNode;
};

type CardPlainProps = CardBaseProps & { expandable?: false };

type CardExpandableProps = CardBaseProps & {
  expandable: true;
  expanded?: boolean;
  expandedContent?: React.ReactNode;
};

type CardProps = CardPlainProps | CardExpandableProps;
```

The discriminated union enforces:

```tsx
<Card expanded>…</Card>                   // ❌ TS error — `expanded` not in plain mode
<Card expandable expandedContent={…}>…</Card>     // ✅ expandable mode
<Card border="solid">…</Card>             // ✅ plain mode
```
